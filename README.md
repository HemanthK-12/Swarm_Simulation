# Swarm Robotics

## Objective

The objective of this project is to simulate and animate the movement of multiple bots. The bots move towards their bestfit line, animated using matplotlib's `animation` functionality.

## Tools Used

- Python: The project is entirely written in Python.
- Matplotlib: Used for creating the animation of the bots' movement.
- Jupyter Notebook: The project includes a Jupyter notebook for detailed explanation and visualization.

## Files in the Project

- `simulation_with_animation.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the simulation and animation code.
- `best_fit_simulation.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains a detailed explanation of the project and the code. It is a great place to start if you're new to the project.

## How to Run the Project

1. Ensure that you have Python and the necessary libraries (matplotlib) installed.
2. Run the `simulation_with_animation.py` script to see the animation of the bots' movement.
3. Open the `Explanation.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter for a detailed explanation and visualization of the project.
